This project uses deep learning algorithms and the Keras library to determine if a person has certain diseases or not from their chest x-rays and other scans. The trained model is displayed using Streamlit, which enables the user to upload an image and receive instant feedback.

Essentially it uses InceptionV3 model to detect. It has been trained on 10,000 images and accuracy is nearly 90%
